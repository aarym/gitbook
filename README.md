# Creating a website... the options

## Introduction

Creating a website can be a simple task when you know how to do it. But that said there  is an overwhelming number of options and even as a IT professional delivering many websites, applications from personal websites, small business to enterprise applications and software-as-a-service products. 

The main takeaway is to understand the options and hopefully help you on your journey in making the right choice for getting your website out there.

## Overview

Firstly, check to see if you need a website or a richer website, known as a web application. 

### What is a website?

Essentially a collection of HTML pages accessed by a URL over the internet. We use browsers to display the HTML pages, which results in aesthetically pleasing, easy to use and rich media websites. This system of information is known as the world wide web.

### What is a web application?

The definition of a web app is a software program accessible over the web, whereas a website is as above, a collection of pages on the world wide web. So the differentiation can be subjective. To me a web application is an advanced, richer website that is used to interact with the user, often has business logic and requires input from the user.

### What is the different between a website & web application? 

Websites are generally for information content, such as news, blogs, company sites or portfolios. Whereas, web apps are typically business apps like e-commerce, e.g. amazon and streaming video & audio, e.g. netflix & spotify.

In summary, many customers, businesses and users do not need to worry about the definitions and generally all the above are referred to as websites. 

## Website Options

### No Developer Experience

Paying for a cloud service which will allow any savy user to publish a website using their app. Including selecting or creating templates, configuring settings and themes, drag and drop content, uploading images & media and generally customising to meet your needs. 

* Website Builders
* Cloud Content Management Systems

### Developer Experience

Website pages / code created or have template that you wish to publish to the web.

* Self-Managed hosted Website \(paid/free\)
* Cloud Platforms for automating and publishing your website \(paid/free\)

There are some terms used interchangeably, such as _CMS_ and _website builders._ When comparing CMSâ€™s vs website builders, it helps to know their intended purpose.

* CMS manages website content, covering all types of content such as articles, blog posts and content pages. Often the CMS will include templates, layouts, offering customisations and themes for generating your website. Often in a CMS there is more configuration options available, such as creating different content types which then can be used to create pages of those types, such as blogs.
* Website Builders can include blogs, e-commerce and other types of content, but their focus and strength is in providing the tools to build the website. Such as a frontend visual website building interface. 

So in summary, website builders are also referred to by some as a CMS and vice-versa. Typically a CMS is more advanced to cater for different content types and creating your own templates and layouts.

## TL; DR

> In the simplest terms, I like to summarise that a website is, an accessible document or collection of documents accessed over the internet. If you look at the origins of the internet, these documents were accessed in company private intranets or on the public internet with very simple text documents with limited images. Nowadays this is still holds true but we've evolved and made these documents, aesthetically pleasing, easy and rich user experiences which are accessible on many devices, such as desktops, mobiles and TVs. In terms of a website today, we access richer content such as media, like images, videos, and audio within these documents.
